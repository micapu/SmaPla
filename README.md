# SmaPla (**Sma**rt **Pla**yer) - A smartly shuffled music player 
### Created as a project in my 6th form years (2016)


Songs will be shuffled according to machine learning adjustments using data your previous song choices/skips according to
* day of week
* time of day
* activity currently being done
* time into activity being done

With this model, there are no playlists. One needs only to dump every song they are interested in to the site after which the algorithm will learn your preferences.
Songs are displayed as a long list with their relative probabilities next to them.
Comprehensive logs are also preserved for future expansion.

Featuring a user account system.
